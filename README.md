# Working with Java Examples

This is a quick VM definition you can use to practice the Java tutorials
on schuchert.github.io.

## Install Prerequs
You'll need a few things:
* Virtalbox
* Vagrant
* A bash shell (e.g. git bash for Windows)


## Create VM

* Clone the repo
```termainl
git clone ...
```

* Switch to the cloned directory
```termaial
cd ...
```

* Run `first_time.sh` and wait for it to finish:
```terminal
./first_time.sh
```

When finished, switch over to VM window.
